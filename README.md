# OpenGL Engine
- Testing grounds to experiment and try to OpenGL rendering and computer graphics programming
- Build a engine that can freely try any graphic techniques as a standalone program.
- Intended to work as a sandbox to enforce technique practice.


# Latest Changes
- Able to implement FMOD for the audio side of this project (didn't know a few projects, but now it makes sense to me)
- Was able to setup the project to use the C API to use the FMOD functions with conjunction of FMOD Studio bank files.

# Current Goals
- Optimize code lines to be ready for sandboxing
- Use ImGui to go through different graphic techniques and principles
- Open world playing field that contain interchangeable parameters.
- Reduction in spaghetti code (streamline and optimized lines)
- Proper documentation for looking back at and for explaining

# Notes
- Lets clean up the structure of the code to make sure we don't need to look back at the current setup
- Features to show (Phong Lighting Editable), transparency, framebuffers, object data,
