# OpenGL Engine
- Testing grounds to experiment and try to OpenGL rendering and computer graphics programming
- Build a engine that can freely try any graphic techniques as a standalone program.
- Intended to work as a sandbox to enforce technique practice.


# Current Goals
- Optimize code lines to be ready for sandboxing
- Use ImGui to go through different graphic techniques and principles
- Open world playing field that contain interchangeable parameters.
- Reduction in spaghetti code (streamline and optimized lines)
- Proper documentation for looking back at and for explaining
